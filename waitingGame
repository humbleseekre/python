Creating games is a fun way to practice programming, so that's what we'll do for this challenge.
Your goal is to write a Python function to play a pulse pounding game of patience I call The Waiting Game.
When the player runs your Waiting Game program, it should print a message for them to wait a random amount of time,
somewhere between two to four seconds. When the player presses Enter, that starts a timer. The player's goal
is to wait the specified number of seconds and then press Enter again. That displays the elapsed time,
along with a message about whether the player was too fast, too slow, or right on target.

import time
import random


def waiting_game():
    target = random.randint(2, 4)
    print("Your target time is {0} seconds".format(target))

    input(' ---Press Enter to Begin--- ')
    start = time.perf_counter()

    input("\n...Press Enter again after {} seconds".format(target))
    elapsed = time.perf_counter() - start

    print('\nElapsed time: {0:.3f} seconds'.format(elapsed))
    if elapsed == target:
        print('(Unbelievable !! Perfect timing)')
    elif elapsed < target:
        print('({0:.3f} seconds too fast)'.format(target-elapsed))
    else:
        print('({0:.3f} seconds too slow)'.format(elapsed - target))
